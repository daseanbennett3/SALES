# TITLE: A Sales Story Using Tableau
# DESCRIPTION:
A company was kind enough to allow me access to their Customers, Location, Orders, and Products tables from the years 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023.

The Customers table gave me the names of the customers. The Location table details the location by giving us everything from the Region to the Postal Code. The Orders table details everything order related from the shipping method to the quantity of the item ordered. The last table, the product table, gives me knowledge on the product ordered and its category and sub-category. With this infromation I created a Tabluea project that displays the most critical information or the comapany to potentially base many of their next year's decision on.

My sales dashboard displays information for the year 2023 starting with the sales for that year with a percentage change from last year just below it. Besides the sales is the profit in a similar design having the percentage change from last year. Beside the profit in the top, far left is the quantity of products sold with the difference from last year displayed under it. 

The first chart at the bottom titled 'Sales & Profit by Subcategory' has two charts within it.
The first of the two comprares the sales of 2023 to the sales of 2022 based on the sub-categopry.
The second chart of the two compares the profit to the loss of 2023 by the sub-category.
