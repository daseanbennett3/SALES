# TITLE: A Sales Story Using Tableau
# DESCRIPTION:
A company has given information in regards to a Customers, Location, Orders, and Products tables from the years 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023.

The Customers table gave me the names of the customers.
The Location table details the location by giving us everything from the Region to the Postal Code.
The Orders table details everything order related from the shipping method to the quantity of the item ordered.
The last table, the product table, gives me knowledge on the product ordered and its category and sub-category.
With this information I created a Tableau project that displays the most critical information for the company to potentially base many of their next year's decision on.

My sales dashboard displays information for the year 2023 starting with the sales for that year with a percentage change from last year just below it.
Right beside the sales is the profit in a similar design having the percentage change from last year.
Beside the profit on the top, far left is the quantity of products sold with the difference from last year displayed under it. 

The first chart at the bottom titled 'Sales & Profit by Subcategory' has two charts within it.
The first of the two compares the sales of 2023 to the sales of 2022 based on the sub-category.
The second chart of the two compares the profits to the losses of 2023 by the sub-category.  

The second graph at the bottom titled 'Sales & Profit Over Time' has two line-charts within it. 
The first of the two line-charts displays the current year's sales (2023).
The second of the two line-charts displays the current year's profits (2023). 

The project is interactive in case a viewer has a different key point of interest they would like to view. There is also a filter available that allows you to pick a key point of interest based on location or the product category. 

A deeper look into each of the KPIs can be found using the links in my 'TABLEAU-FILES.md' file.
